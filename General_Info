# The Garbage Collector (GC) in Java is an automatic memory management system that reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer used or referenced by a running Java program.
  This process helps prevent memory leaks and ensures efficient use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)'s heap memory.
