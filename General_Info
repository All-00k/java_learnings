#every java fiel use the package 
import java.lang.*;

#on object creation:-
MyClass obj = new MyClass();   //MyClass() is a constructor.....

#We can use a method of a Class into another Class by making object of first class in second class's main  function and then callling the method with the help of object created......

#while doing inheritance we can excess public, protected, default parameters(methods, variables) in child classes.....we can not do it for private stuffs..

#INHERITANCE :-----
                Is-a and Has-a


# To change a Integer to STring
String str_Name = String.valueOf(That_Integer);



# With static, count belongs to the class (shared among all objects).
# Without static, count belongs to each object (separate copy for each).

#how to change int to string
//int myInteger = 123;
//String myString = String.valueOf(myInteger);


# The Garbage Collector (GC) in Java is an automatic memory management system that reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer used or referenced by a running Java program.
  This process helps prevent memory leaks and ensures efficient use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)'s heap memory.

# The this keyword in Java is a reference variable that refers to the current object or instance of the class within which it is used. 
  It essentially means "this object" and allows you to distinguish between instance variables and local variables (like method parameters) that might have the same name
lets see it as:=
        public class Person {
        String name; // Instance variable

        public Person(String name) {
            this.name = name; // 'this.name' refers to the instance variable ..............the parameter and instance variable have same name so we use this to differentiate between them
                              // 'name' refers to the parameter
        }
    }


# if any method is static we can access it with the help of Class itself
        let say static void show() is method of ABC class so --> ABC.show() is the way to call method with the help of class itself
